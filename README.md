### Augmented Reality Navigation App

This project provides a basic implementation of an Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation App in Java. The app allows users to view an AR map and get directions to their desired destination.

### Features:

1. **View AR Map**: Users can view an augmented reality map.
2. **Get Directions**: Users can get directions to their destination using GPS and map services.
3. **Simple Interface**: The app provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java file: `javac ARNavigationApp.java`
3. Run the compiled class file: `java ARNavigationApp`
4. Choose an option from the menu to view the AR map or get directions.

### Dependencies:

- This project does not require any external dependencies as it only provides a basic skeleton for an AR Navigation App.

### Future Improvements:

- Integration with AR libraries for a more immersive AR experience.
- Integration with GPS functionality and map services to provide real-time navigation.
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.

### Note:

This project serves as a starting point for building a more robust and feature-rich Augmented Reality Navigation App in Java. Additional functionality and improvements can be made based on specific project requirements and user needs.
